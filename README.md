In brief, to increase specificity of the cancer signal in the cell-free DNA, i.e. in our using small cell lung cancer (SCLC) liquid biopsy samples, compared to non-cancer noise ratio, we implemented a novel approach utilizing *paired* peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) genomic DNA collected from the same plasma source material of patient with SCLC at identical timepoints. Comparison of total plasma cell-free DNA to PBL genomic DNA by principal component analysis revealed that PBLs exhibited a distinct methylation signal. We implemented our novel algorithmic filter, PRIME, to reduce the PBL methylation signals. We started with whole-genome windows (n = 9,603,445), removed ENCODE-blacklist regions, and then selected windows hypomethylated across PBLs (median beta per window < 0.2). Within these PBL-hypomethylated windows, we further selected for windows with a CG-density threshold >= 5 to account for the functionality of the 5-methylcytosine antibody. Thus, PRIME filtered out non-tumor noise in the cfDNA, reducing 9,603,445 whole-genome windows to 196,582 SCLC-specific windows.
